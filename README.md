# üìà Stock Price Prediction Using Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS)

This project explores the predictive capabilities of **Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS)** for stock price forecasting. Specifically, the study compares three fuzzy logic models: **Sugeno FIS**, **Mamdani FIS**, and **Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)**. By integrating these models with **Gradient Descent Optimization**, the project demonstrates an enhanced ability to predict stock prices with improved accuracy.

## üéØ Key Features

1. **Models Implemented**:
   - **Sugeno FIS**: Uses optimized triangular membership functions for better adaptability.
   - **Mamdani FIS**: Focuses on interpretability through trapezoidal membership functions and expert-defined rules.
   - **ANFIS**: Combines the learning capability of neural networks with fuzzy logic for dynamic rule adjustment.

2. **Optimization**:
   - **Gradient Descent**: Enhances model performance by fine-tuning membership functions and rule weights.

3. **Error Metrics Evaluated**:
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
   - R-Squared (R¬≤)
   - Mean Percentage Error (MPE)

4. **Visualization**:
   - Graphical comparisons of model predictions.
   - Performance metrics visualized using line plots and bar charts.

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Normalizes the features (`open`, `high`, `low`, `volume`) and the target variable (`close`) for better model performance.

### 2. Fuzzy Inference Systems
- **Sugeno FIS**:
  - Employs triangular membership functions.
  - Optimized using gradient descent to minimize prediction errors.
- **Mamdani FIS**:
  - Utilizes trapezoidal membership functions with expert-defined rules for interpretability.
- **ANFIS**:
  - Integrates fuzzy logic with neural networks for dynamic learning and adaptation.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Evaluates performance using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R¬≤, and MPE.
- Visualizes predictions and performance metrics for easy comparison.
